# Summer Research 2023 -- Marissa's WGS Analysis
The structure of the repository is as shown below:
<br/>
<br/>


| Folder          | Description
| -------- | ------- |
| SNP_analysis    | The folder with scripts and original pathnames. Internal folders contain the .rds files that were output by my script, and are the input files for other scripts.| 
| SNP_analysis_md | Contains .md versions of my scripts with descriptions and more documentation about how they work; Note: Some pathnames will not be correct, but useful for following logical workflow.| 
| Sarek           | Input and config files I used to run the nfcore variant caller pipeline.|
